This is the repository for the frontend of [cookbook.gg](https://cookbook.gg)!
## Getting Started
1. Install all project dependencies using your preferred command. Some examples are using `yarn`, `npm i`, or `pnpm`
2. Populate `.env` file with variables `API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` both set to the URL for your locally ran API server
    - if you don't have the API set up locally then go take a peek at [the api repo](https://github.com/CookbookGG/api) which will tell you exactly how to set it up
3. Now you can run the development server using any of the below commands:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
4. Open the served website at the URL shown in the shell output. The default port will be `3000` [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. That's it! Now have fun and be free
